notes:

Ottawa U - prints names with a lot of space between first and last names
ULaval - prints last and first names glued together


short term:

-> now i can get to season best page. need to store every athlete's url into db
-> need main to use db info (athlete info (name, uni, url)) 
-> need to store pbs into db
-> possible issue: swimrankings blocks me for boting...maybe try to do 3-5 athletes at a time (other possible solns)


long term:

-> find a way to get athlete lists for random unis (York, Carleton, etc.)
-> create front end for application
-> db should already add new swimmers after new season, but make it remove old ones...so it stays clean
