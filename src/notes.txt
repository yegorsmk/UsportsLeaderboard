notes:

Ottawa U - prints names with a lot of space between first and last names
ULaval - prints last and first names glued together


short term:


long term:

-> create a ranking system (top 50) for each event, and for universities
-> find a way to separate teams into 2 genders when they're not already separated
-> find a way to get athlete lists for random unis (York, Carleton, etc.), upload all swimmers
-> add relays to ranking
-> create front end for application (simple, clear, easy to use)
-> db should already add new swimmers after new season, but make it remove old ones...so it stays clean
-> deploy on docker, make it run/update every week (mid week)
